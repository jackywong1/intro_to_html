    DIVS are basically a box that stretches to the width of the website and grows
    with the contents within the div. Divs are block-level content. 
    These blocks can be arranged however you want on a webpage.
    SPAN allows you to change the properties of a user-set length of content
    In the css file, use '.' to access different CLASSES to further separate out 
    different paragraph, div, span tags and change the properties of each.
    'id' also serves a similar purpose, but you can only have ONE id per page. 
    'ids' are called using '#'
    'classes' are called using '.'
    You can use classes over and over again
